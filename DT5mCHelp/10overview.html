In the final part of the scene in Gods and Dogs,
a male dancer performs solo movement.
When the stage lights turn dim, worms start roaming on his body,
expressing by projection from the ceiling bridge or back end of the theatre space.
This projection follows the dancer's movement, then dispears when he moves back toword the backdrop.
The following figure illustrates a typical setup of equipments in the theatre space.
Both the camera and the projector are placed on the ceiling bridge together with the computer.

Two applications run on the computer,
the one processes the camera image to detect the dencer's body,
and the other one, this DT5mC, organizes swarm simulation and produces the image in which worms are roaming.
