<p>
The above figure shows a sample of projection window in <b>Masking</b>
<a href="20Display.html#ProjectionMode">mode</a>.
Blue and light yellow areas are effective, but black and dark yellow areas are ignored
even if the tracker module detected something to be target.
Light and dark yellow indicate the area detected by the tracker,
but dark parts are ignored by this software as targets.
It is useful when it's difficult to eliminate noise in fixed areas by the tracker software.
</p></p>
This mode allows you to edit the masking filter.
You can add the filtering area by dragging the mouse on the window.
Pressing the option key during your dragging, you can erase the area.
The button at the top left corner of the window allows you to add the current detected area as noise.
<b>Clear</b> button erases all of filtering area.
You can erase a single enclosed area by the contextual menu popped up by pressing the mouse button with control key.
You can change the brush size by type in digits.
The latest operation can be cancelled by <b>Undo</b> operation by <b>Edit</b> menu of the menu bar,
and its short cut key <b>&#x2318;Z</b>.
You can <b>Redo</b> the undone operation from the menu bar and the short cut key <b>&#x21e7;&#x2318;Z</b>.
The button entitled <b>Save as Default Mask</b> is to save current mask pattern as
a part of default parameters so as to reuse it in the next time this software launched.
