<figcaption>GUI elements to display control.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The above figure shows two buttons, a switch, and a popup button for display controls
at the top part of the control panel.
</p>
<h3>Start and Stop</h3>
<p>
You can stop and start the simulation process by clicking the buttons
at top left part of the control panel.
The same operations are possible by the menu items <b>Start</b> and <b>Stop</b>
in the <b>Projection</b> menu in the menu bar, whose shortcut keys are
<b>⌘G</b> and <b>⇧⌘G</b> respectively.
When you stop the simulation, the projection swarm disappears suddenly,
but it appears gradually by <b>Fade in time</b> when it starts again.
You can change this duration by alternate the value displayed at middle right part of the control panel,
as shown in a figure in the later section of <a href="60Appearance.html">Appearance</a>.
</p>
<h3>Full Screen Mode</h3>
<p>
The switch at the top middle is to turn the full screen mode on and off.
If your computer has more than one screens, the control panel can stay visible when the projection
and the control panel are placed in the different screens.
The switch is effective to turn the full screen mode off.
The menu item <b>Full Screen</b> in the <b>Projection</b> menu in the menu bar has the same
function to switch the mode.
The shortcut key of this menu item is <b>⌘F</b>, that is effective to turn the mode off
even when the control panel is hidden behind the full screen projection.
<b>ESC</b> key also has the same effect to exit from the full screen mode.
</p>
<h4>Selecting screen for full screen mode</h4>
<p>
In usual setups, a projector is attached to the video output port
of the computer as the secondary screen.
A typical example is a HDMI connection with MacBook Pro without screen mirroring.
In this case, you don't need to make any changes for screen settings since
this software selects the secondary screen for full screen mode.
In case your computer has more than two screens,
it is helpful to specify the screen to be used for full screen mode,
by a popup button at the bottom part of control panel.
The menu attached to this button contains the items entitled screen names.

<h3>Selecting Projection Mode</h3>
<p>
Using the popup button at the top right part of control panel,
you can choose one of the projection modes;
<b>Normal</b>, <b>Adjustment</b>, <b>Masking</b>, <b>Attractant</b>, and <b>Repellent</b>.
The menu items of the same titles in the <b>Projection</b> menu in the menu bar
are also available to change the mode.
Each mode displays as follows.
<ul>
<li><b>Normal</b>: swarm animation for the real performance.</li>
<li><b>Adjustment</b>: detected area and grid for geometric
	<a href="30Adjustment.html">adjustment</a>.</li>
<li><b>Masking</b>: to edit the masking bitmap to avoid interference by noise.
<li><b>Attractant</b>, <b>Repellent</b>: monitoring the distribution of those
	virtual chemicals to control the swarm behaviour.
</ul>
