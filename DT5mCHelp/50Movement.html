<p>
You can modify the movement of swarm by the following six parameters:
</p>
<ol> 
<li><b>Speed</b>: velocity magnitude of agents in the target area.</li>
<li><b>Turn</b>: turning angle.</li>
<li><b>Avoidance</b>: weight of repellent force for integration with attraction force.</li>
<li><b>Lo speed th.</b>: lower threshold of attractant's density for target area.</li>
<li><b>Hi speed th.</b>: upper threshold of attractant's density for agent into high speed exploration.</li>
<li><b>High speed</b>: velocity of agents for exploration at the outside of target area.</li>
<li><b>Life span</b>: interval in seconds to force an agent to warp to a random place.
Agents do not warp when this value is zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The swarm behaviour depends on the distribution of two types of virtual chemicals, attractant and repellent.
These distributions are represented by separated two dimensional arrays of floating point numbers in the computer's memory.
The arrangement is evenly mapped to the square lattice covering the area where the agents move.
Each cell in the lattice corresponds to a small square of each position.
</p><p>
To make the dancer's image to attract agents, the cells under the detected target
is filled with the maximum value of attractant density (is equal to 1).
To distribute agents properly without too dense crowd, each agent put maximum density of repellent at its position.
By applying diffusion and evaporation, the attractant summons agents from surrounds,
and the repellent separates them each other.
You can adjust the parameters for both diffusion and evaporation for each distribution
by the GUI elements in the middle part of the control panel shown above.
