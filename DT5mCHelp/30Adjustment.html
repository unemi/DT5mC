It might be necessary to adjust geometry of projection to fit
the projection with the dancer's position and scale not by physical
positioning of equipments but by this software.
When you change the <a href="20Display.html#ProjectionMode">projection mode</a>
to <b>Adjustment</b>, the projection window displays the detected area and grid lines
as shown in the following figure.

Then switch the projection to the full screen mode to check how the projected image fits the detected target.

<p>
The control panel has five sets of controls to adjust the parameters;
<b>X Offset</b>, <b>Y Offset</b>, <b>X Scale</b>, <b>Y Scale</b>, and <b>Keystone</b>.
Offsets and scales change position and magnitude of target area in the projected image.
Keystone does not affect the target adjustment, but scaling of swarm image.
Because the projection on the stage is tilted, it's necessary to adjust the keystone parameter
so that the vertical grid lines projected on the stage surface should be aligned parallel.
This adjustment makes the swarm image look same size even when the dancer moves back and forth on the stage.
</p><p>
You can change the value of each parameter by operating a slider, a stepper, and digits key-in.
The increment and decrement unit of the steppers are ±0.01 in default.
It becomes ±0.1 (or ±0.001) if <b>shift</b> key (or <b>control</b> key) is pressed when you click the stepper.
Your input of digits becomes effective after you move to another control for key-in
by <b>tab</b> key or by clicking another text field.
</p><p>
You can save all of parameter settings as user's default by clicking
<b>Save As Default</b> button at bottom right corner in the control panel.
The saved values are applied when you launch this application again in next time.
