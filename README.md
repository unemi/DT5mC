This software was developed by [Tatsuo Unemi](http://www.intlab.soka.ac.jp/~unemi/) for the stage effect of "Gods and Dogs,"
a contemporary ballet choreographed by [Jiří Kylián](http://www.jirikylian.com) in 2008,
that works together with another software for camera image processing developed by
[Daniel Bisig](https://www.zhdk.ch/person/dr-daniel-bisig-152317).

In 2023, the code was revised to be adaptable to 4K 60Hz projector and 16:9 camera image utilising GPU power.

### Machine requirement
This software runs on Apple's Mac computer equipped with Apple Silicon CPU/GPU.
macOS 12.0 or later operating system is required.
